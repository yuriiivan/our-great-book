Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.


Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Why did you bring us here? For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Oh yeah, good luck with that.
I'm a thing.

Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!

    I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!
    Pansy.
    Really?!

Shut up and take my money!

And I'm his friend Jesus. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

    Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!
    With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!
    No argument here.

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?

No! Don't jump! No! The cat shelter's on to me. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Tell her she looks thin. It doesn't look so shiny to me. It must be wonderful.

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Who am I making this out to?

Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.

Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. No! Don't jump! I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Why would I want to know that? I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!

Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Ask her how her day was. Ask her how her day was.

Ow, my spirit! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.

I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. I never loved you. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!
